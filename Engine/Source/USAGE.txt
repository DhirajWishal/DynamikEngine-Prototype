Dynamik Engine usage.

The Dynamik Engine APIs are provided as singletons. This allows the users to communicate with the enigine at any
given instance only if the API is properly initialized. The clients code will be compiled to an executable which 
is platform specific. The engine is compiled to a static library file and will be linked to the client application.
Almost all of the clients logic is passed to the engine and it is handled internally.
