TODO:
	Make a class called BufferManager which has the following:
		Create/ Delete/ Update Vertex Buffer
		Create/ Delete/ Update Index Buffer
		Create/ Delete/ Update Uniform Buffer
		*Create/ Delete/ Update Depth Buffer
		*Create/ Delete/ Update Color Buffer
		*Create/ Delete/ Update Frame Buffer
		*Create/ Delete/ Update Command Buffer
	
	Make another class called ModelManager which has:
		Load Model
		Load Texture
		Update Texture
		*Hot Reloading
	
	Separate the initializing pipeline as,
		basic initializer (instance and device)
		pipeline initializer (pipeline, shaders and swapchain)
		model initializer (vertex, index, uniform, depth, color buffer initialization and load model)
		final initializer (commandBuffers and semaphores)
	
	submition of the buffers
	draw call
		multiple buffer drawings
