validation layer: descriptorSet #0 being bound is not compatible with overlapping descriptorSetLayout at index 0 of pipelineLayout 0x11 due to:
 Binding 0 for DescriptorSetLayout 000000000000000B has a descriptorCount of 1 but binding 0 for DescriptorSetLayout 000000000000000C, which comes from pipelineLayout,
 has a descriptorCount of 0. The Vulkan spec states: Each element of pDescriptorSets must have been allocated with a VkDescriptorSetLayout that matches 
(is the same as, or identically defined as) the VkDescriptorSetLayout at set n in layout, where n is the sum of firstSet and the index into pDescriptorSets 
(https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-vkCmdBindDescriptorSets-pDescriptorSets-00358)
